  - [ ] Complete `marketplace.ts` service tests (functions exist but tests fail)
  - [ ] `products.ts` service tests
  - [ ] `workspace.ts` service tests
  - [ ] `dashboard.ts` service tests

### **Phase 6: Complete Backend API Endpoint Tests**
- [ ] **Store Connections Tests:** 
  - [ ] Fix data model issues in `stores.test.ts` (marketplaces vs marketplaceType)
  - [ ] Complete all store CRUD operations testing
  - [ ] Test marketplace connection validation

- [ ] **Products API Tests:**
  - [ ] Complete `products.test.ts` implementation
  - [ ] Test product sync functionality
  - [ ] Test product description updates
  - [ ] Test marketplace integration

- [ ] **Missing Endpoint Tests:**
  - [ ] Admin panel endpoints (`/api/admin/*`)
  - [ ] Dashboard analytics endpoints (`/api/dashboard/*`)
  - [ ] Opportunities & optimizations endpoints
  - [ ] Usage tracking endpoints (`/api/usage/*`)
  - [ ] Billing endpoints (`/api/billing/*`)

### **Phase 7: Pre-Commit Hooks & Automation**
- [ ] **Install and Configure Husky:**
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged
  npx husky install
  ```

- [ ] **Pre-commit Hook Configuration:**
  - [ ] Run linting on staged files
  - [ ] Run type checking on staged files  
  - [ ] Run relevant tests for changed files
  - [ ] Ensure coverage thresholds are met

- [ ] **Pre-push Hook Configuration:**
  - [ ] Run full test suite before pushing
  - [ ] Verify all tests pass
  - [ ] Check coverage thresholds

### **Phase 8: Advanced Testing Features**

#### **Performance & Load Testing**
- [ ] **API Load Testing:**
  - [ ] Install Artillery or k6 for load testing
  - [ ] Test critical endpoints under load
  - [ ] Test database connection limits
  - [ ] Test subscription limit enforcement under load

- [ ] **Frontend Performance Testing:**
  - [ ] Add Lighthouse CI for performance auditing
  - [ ] Test component rendering performance
  - [ ] Test large dataset handling

#### **Visual Regression Testing**
- [ ] **Playwright Visual Testing:**
  - [ ] Add visual comparison tests for key pages
  - [ ] Test responsive breakpoints visually
  - [ ] Test dark/light theme consistency
  - [ ] Test cross-browser visual consistency

#### **Security Testing**
- [ ] **API Security Tests:**
  - [ ] Test SQL injection prevention
  - [ ] Test XSS prevention
  - [ ] Test CSRF protection
  - [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness
  - [ ] Test JWT token security

- [ ] **Data Privacy Tests:**
  - [ ] Test workspace data isolation rigorously
  - [ ] Test user data deletion compliance
  - [ ] Test sensitive data exposure

### **Phase 9: Test Data Management**
- [ ] **Test Data Factories:**
  - [ ] Create comprehensive data factories for all models
  - [ ] Add realistic test data generation
  - [ ] Create test data seeding scripts

- [ ] **Test Environment Management:**
  - [ ] Create isolated test environments per feature branch
  - [ ] Add test data cleanup automation
  - [ ] Add test performance monitoring

### **Phase 10: Documentation & Training**
- [ ] **Testing Documentation:**
  - [ ] Create testing guide for new developers
  - [ ] Document testing patterns and conventions
  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common test issues

- [ ] **API Testing Documentation:**
  - [ ] Update Postman collection with test examples
  - [ ] Document API testing patterns
  - [ ] Create integration testing cookbook

## 🔧 **Current Issues to Fix**

### **Backend Test Issues**
1. **Store Connection Tests (`stores.test.ts`):**
   - Problem: API expects `marketplaceType` but test sends `marketplaces` array
   - Solution: Align test data with actual API contract
   - Location: `/server/src/__tests__/integration/stores.test.ts`

2. **Subscription Tests (`subscriptions.test.ts`):**
   - Problem: Some middleware issues with plan access
   - Solution: Fix middleware chain setup in tests
   - Location: `/server/src/__tests__/integration/subscriptions.test.ts`

### **Frontend Test Issues**
1. **Marketplace Service Tests:**
   - Problem: Functions don't exist in service file
   - Solution: Implement missing functions or update test expectations
   - Location: `/client/src/services/__tests__/marketplace.test.ts`

2. **Component Tests:**
   - Problem: Components not rendering in test environment
   - Solution: Fix provider setup and mocking
   - Location: `/client/src/components/workspace/__tests__/workspace-selector.test.tsx`

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

### **Coverage Goals**
- [ ] **Backend**: Maintain >80% coverage across all metrics
- [ ] **Frontend**: Maintain >70% coverage across all metrics
- [ ] **E2E**: Cover all critical user journeys
- [ ] **Integration**: Test all API endpoints

### **Quality Gates**
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] No test flakiness (>95% pass rate)
- [ ] Fast test execution (<5 minutes for full suite)
- [ ] Comprehensive error scenario coverage

### **Developer Experience Goals**
- [ ] Tests run automatically on save (watch mode)
- [ ] Clear error messages when tests fail
- [ ] Easy test debugging with good tooling
- [ ] Minimal test setup required for new developers

## 🚀 **Implementation Priority**

**HIGH PRIORITY (Complete First):**
1. Fix existing test failures
2. Complete store and product API tests
3. Add component tests for critical UI components
4. Set up pre-commit hooks

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
1. Add missing endpoint tests
2. Implement performance testing
3. Add visual regression testing
4. Enhance test data management

**LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancements):**
1. Advanced security testing
2. Load testing infrastructure
3. Test analytics and reporting
4. Advanced test automation
